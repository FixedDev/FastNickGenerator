# FastNickGenerator
A fast nick generator created in C++ to practice.
It generates nicks based on 2 dictionaries and a final number at the end from 0-9999.

The dictionaries need to be on the same folder as the executable with the names `beginning` and `middle`. The result is saved on a file called result

The nick generator can generate nicks in batches to allow machines with less ram to generate lots of them.
